# Weather Calendar Feature

## Overview

The Weather Calendar is a new feature that provides 30-day weather predictions with AI-powered rainfall forecasts. It combines data from OpenWeather API with custom AI models running on FastAPI to deliver accurate and actionable weather insights.

## Features

### üóìÔ∏è Interactive Calendar
- Visual 30-day calendar with color-coded risk levels
- Click on any date to view detailed weather information
- Smooth animations and hover effects
- Responsive design for mobile and desktop

### üå¶Ô∏è Weather Data Sources
1. **OpenWeather One Call API** - Real-time weather data with 8-day forecasts
2. **FastAPI AI Predictions** - 30-day forecasts using Prophet/ARIMA models with rainfall prediction

### üîî Daily Notifications
- Enable browser notifications for daily weather updates
- Receive alerts at 7 AM each day
- Smart risk-level notifications (high, moderate, low)

### üìä Risk Assessment
- **Low Risk** (Green) - Favorable conditions for outdoor activities
- **Moderate Risk** (Yellow) - Caution advised, check details
- **High Risk** (Red) - Severe weather conditions expected

### üìà AI Rainfall Prediction
The FastAPI backend uses a balanced algorithm considering:
- **Humidity** (50% weight) - Primary indicator
- **Pressure** (30% weight) - Storm system detection
- **Temperature** (20% weight) - Moisture capacity factor

The model has been calibrated to avoid over-prediction and provides realistic rainfall probabilities.

## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+ and npm
- Python 3.8+
- OpenWeather API key (free tier available)

### Frontend Setup

1. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. **Configure environment variables:**
   Create a `.env` file in the root directory:
   ```env
   VITE_OPENWEATHER_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
   ```
   
   Get your free API key at: https://openweathermap.org/api
   
   Note: The One Call API 3.0 requires signing up for a subscription (free tier includes 1,000 calls/day)

3. **Start the development server:**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
   
   The app will be available at http://localhost:5173 (or another port if 5173 is busy)

### Backend Setup (FastAPI)

1. **Navigate to the forecast service directory:**
   ```bash
   cd forecast_service
   ```

2. **Install Python dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Start the FastAPI server:**
   ```bash
   python -m uvicorn app:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
   ```
   
   Or simply:
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```
   
   The API will be available at http://localhost:8000

4. **Verify the service is running:**
   ```bash
   curl http://localhost:8000/health
   ```

## Usage Guide

### Accessing the Calendar

1. Navigate to the Calendar page using the navigation menu
2. Or visit directly: http://localhost:5173/calendar

### Getting Weather Predictions

1. **Enter a Location:**
   - Type a city name (e.g., "New York", "London")
   - Or enter coordinates (e.g., "40.7128, -74.0060")

2. **Fetch Weather Data:**
   - Click "Fetch Weather Data" to get OpenWeather predictions (8 days)
   - Click "Get AI Predictions" to generate 30-day AI forecasts

3. **View Details:**
   - Click any date on the calendar to see detailed information
   - View temperature, humidity, pressure, wind speed, and rainfall predictions

4. **Enable Notifications:**
   - Click "Enable Daily Notifications"
   - Grant browser permission when prompted
   - Receive daily weather updates at 7 AM

### Understanding the Data

**Weather Details Card shows:**
- üå°Ô∏è Temperature (current, min, max)
- üíß Humidity percentage
- üß≠ Atmospheric pressure
- üí® Wind speed
- üåßÔ∏è Rainfall probability and predicted amount

**30-Day Summary includes:**
- Number of low, moderate, and high-risk days
- Average temperature over 30 days
- Total predicted rainfall
- Forecast period dates

## Troubleshooting

### "AI Service Offline" message
- Ensure FastAPI server is running on port 8000
- Check the terminal for any error messages
- Verify Python dependencies are installed

### No weather data showing
- Check your OpenWeather API key is correctly set in `.env`
- Ensure you have an active internet connection
- Check browser console for error messages

### Notifications not working
- Ensure browser notifications are enabled in settings
- Check that HTTPS is enabled (required for service workers in production)
- Try the test notification button first

### Calendar tiles not color-coded
- Fetch weather data or AI predictions first
- Ensure location is selected
- Check browser console for errors
